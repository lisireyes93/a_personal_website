    <p>Hello my name is Alicia, I am currently a Flatiron student. I picked up an interest in Software Engineering after my husband decided to go to Flatiron himself and got a job in the field. I liked how excited he was talk t me about stuff that I didnâ€™t even understand, and slowly the idea of me going to Flatiron started growing more and more each day. At the moment I was working at a bank and at first I absolutely loved my job but day after day I started finding things I did not like. One day I just woke up and decided to put my two weeks notice in and decided to enroll into Flatiron.</p>
    <p>In the next few weeks I hope to learn a lot so that I can also start a career I can be happy about. </p>
